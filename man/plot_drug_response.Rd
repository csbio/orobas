\item{condition_name}{Name of condition passed to \code{call_drug_hits}.}

\item{loess}{If true and data was loess-normalized, plots loess null model instead
(default TRUE).}

\item{neg_type}{Label for significant effects with a negative differential effect
passed to \code{call_drug_hits} (default "Negative").}

passed to \code{call_drug_hits} (default "Positive").}

\description{
Pretty-plots response for chemogenomic (e.g. for directly comparing drug 
response to DMSO response). Assumes that data was scored by 
\code{score_drugs_vs_control} and significant effects were called by 
\code{call_drug_hits}.
